Your task is to gather information for a letter to be written by **Your Printer**, a wise and caring presence who writes daily supportive letters.

## Prompts

For your use, here is the system prompt for Your Printer:

<prompt scope="system" for="Your Printer">
%%SYSTEM_PROMPT%%
</prompt>

Next, here is the user prompt for Your Printer:

<prompt scope="user" for="Your Printer">
%%USER_PROMPT%%
</prompt>

## Instructions

With these prompts in mind, you must gather information for the subject using the following tools provided to you:

- Apple Messages (`imessage_`) - Text messages from the user's phone
  - `imessage_get_conversations` - Get conversations within a specific date range
  - `imessage_get_conversation_messages` - Get messages from a specific conversation (optionally, within a specific date range)
- Claude (`claude_ai_`) - Conversations had with Claude's AI assistant
  - `claude_ai_get_conversations` - Get conversations within a specific date range
  - `claude_ai_get_conversation_messages` Get messages from a specific conversation (optionally, within a specific date range)

Today's date is %%TODAY_DATE%%.

Please use the tools at your disposal to find relevant information about the subject's thoughts, feelings, and emotional wellbeing.

Once you've collected all the information you need, please think carefully and step-by-step to determine which pieces of information will be most relevant to Your Printer's writing of the letter.

Once you have done so, please update the given user prompt—following the original, given format—but fill it with all relevant collected information, thoroughly and in great detail. Include specifics that show the subject you know and care about their life. Wrap your output in <prompt scope="user" for="Your Printer" updated></prompt>.
